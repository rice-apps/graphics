                Developers are the primary workforce for all the projects. Tasks will be assigned to each developer at a weekly meeting, which should be completed by the next meeting. Developers can work on a variety of areas, such as frontend, mobile development, backend, etc. Whatever you're interested in!
            </p>

            <p>
                There is a separate waitlist for each project for developers. You can complete any project's minitasks to get bumped to the top of the waitlist of that project. Please see the Minitask tab for details.
            </p>

            <p>

            <p>
                Designers work together as a team to help out with UI/UX for all projects. Each designer is assigned to a team as a point of contact for the team lead, but all the designers work together to create the frontend for the project. The graphics design to HTML/CSS/JavaScript coding ratio is about 35:65. But as always, you're free to focus on whatever you like!
            </p>

            <p>
                There is only one waitlist for all designers. You can get bumped to the top of the waitlist by submitting examples of your visual/web designs to xal1@rice.edu.

            <p>
                Applications are accepted on a rolling basis. Your position on the waitlist is almost solely determined by the timestamp of your application submission. However, completing minitasks shows us that you're a motivated developer and will bump you to the top of the waitlist. Click the positions on the left to learn more about them!
            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                A minitask is similar to the tasks that developers normally complete every week. However, they are simplified so that most COMP 140/182 students should be able to complete the tasks, if they Google smartly. Once you complete a task, send your code to the team lead. He or she will review the code and either immediately accept you or bump you to the top of that project's waitlist. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Current Minitasks:
                <ul>
                    <li>Wellbeing - Create the scene for the alcohol shots calculator</li>
                    <li>Wellbeing - Create the marker for the Night Escort bus </li>
